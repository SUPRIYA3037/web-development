            Organic farming, also known as ecological farming or biological farming,
            [1][2][3][4][5] is an agricultural system that uses fertilizers of
            organic origin such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal
            and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion
            planting. It originated early in the 20th century in reaction to
            rapidly changing farming practices. Certified organic agriculture account
            for 70 million hectares (170 million acres) globally, with over half of
            that total in Australia.[6] Organic farming continues to be developed
            by various organizations today. Biological pest control, mixed cropping,
            and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. Organic standards 
            are designed to allow the use of naturally-occurring substances while
            prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances.[7] For
            instance, naturally-occurring pesticides such as pyrethrin are permitted, 
            while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are generally prohibited.
